# OHDSI Train-the-Trainer

Learn how to navigate the OHDSI ecosystem—from data model to advanced analytics.

This multi-day training series provides participants with a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to the OHDSI ecosystem and its suite of analytic tools. Through guided sessions, attendees will gain familiarity with the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), standardized vocabularies, and data quality principles before progressing to cohort development, data extraction, and advanced analytics in ATLAS and HADES. The program is designed to support participants at all levels—from those new to OHDSI tools to analysts and statisticians looking to deepen their technical expertise. Optional advanced sessions are available for those interested in treatment pathway analysis and applying OHDSI’s R-based HADES framework for research and publication.
