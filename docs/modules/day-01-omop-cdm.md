# 🗓️ Day 1 · OMOP Common Data Model and Standardized Vocabularies

Welcome to **Day 1 of the OHDSI Training Series**!  
Today we introduce the **OMOP Common Data Model (CDM)** — the foundation for all OHDSI analytics.  
You’ll learn how data are organized, standardized, and queried using the OMOP vocabulary tables.

- Need queries? See **[Day 1 · Code Snippets](../exercises/code_snippets/day-01-snippets.md)**.

---

### 2️⃣ Query the `concept` Table
```sql
SELECT concept_id,
       concept_name,
       vocabulary_id,
       standard_concept
FROM concept
WHERE concept_name LIKE 'Major depressive disorder%';
```
➡ Identify which are standard (`'S'`) vs non-standard (`NULL`).

---

### 3️⃣ Map a Non-Standard Code to a Standard Concept
```sql
SELECT *
FROM concept_relationship
WHERE concept_id_1 = <nonstandard_id>
  AND relationship_id = 'Maps to';
```
➡ Find the standard `concept_id_2`.

---

### 4️⃣ Explore Concept Relationships
```sql
SELECT cr.relationship_id,
       c.concept_name AS related_concept,
       c.domain_id
FROM concept_relationship cr
JOIN concept c ON cr.concept_id_2 = c.concept_id
WHERE cr.concept_id_1 = <standard_concept_id>;
```
- Look for “Is a,” “Subsumes,” and “Mapped from” relationships.  
- Note hierarchical links for concept set creation.

## 🏁 Instructor Notes
- Demonstrate basic SQL queries live.  
- Encourage use of Athena to confirm concept IDs.  
- Remind learners that vocabularies update frequently — document versions.  
- Optional challenge: map ICD codes to SNOMED standards and compare results.
