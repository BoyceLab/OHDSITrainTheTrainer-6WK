# Day 2 · Data Quality & Concept Sets

## 📘 Required Reading (Before Class)

### From *The Book of OHDSI*:
- **Chapter 10 — Cohort Definitions**
- **Chapter 5.1 & 5.2 Exercises** from “Standardized Vocabularies” (homework review in class)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 2, participants will be able to:

1. **Describe core OHDSI data quality principles**, including the Kahn Framework, related OHDSI tools, and their role in CDM curation.  
2. **Construct and evaluate concept sets in ATLAS**, including diagnosis, measurement, and drug exposure concepts.  
3. **Explain how standardized vocabularies and concept sets enable consistent, reproducible cohort definitions** in OHDSI.  
4. **Recognize how concept set design and data quality practices combine to support trustworthy observational research.**
